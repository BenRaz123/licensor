# üìù Licensor

## What is this?

**Licensor** is a command line tool that leverages an easy TUI to set up licenses.

Whenever most of us create a Git repository, we often do not care to include a license. This is because the process of creating a `LICENSE` file is cumbersome and annoying and us developers dont have time for that type of thing.

While it is annoying to create a license, the absence of one makes contributing to a project impossible as there is no open-source guarantees.

The solution is licensor.
